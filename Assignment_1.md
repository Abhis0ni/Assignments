# Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
- Python is an interpreted,object oriented programming language.It is used for different variety of development tasks and in fields like artificial intelligence,ML etc.It is easy to learn,read and understand for humans as compared to other programming languages that is why we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language. 


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
- In Python, there is no need to define types of variables and the type is determined only during runtime. This is why Python is called a dynamically typed language.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
- Advantages:
1) Easy to read,learn and write
2) Interpreted language
3) Dynamically typed
4) Free and open source
5) Vast varity of libraries support
6) Portability
- Disadvantages:
1) Slow speed of execution
2) Not memory efficient
3) Weak in mobile computing and browsers
4) Underdeveloped database access layers


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
- Python can be used in following domains
1) Machine learning
2) Artificial Intelligence
3) Desktop GUI
4) Game development
5) Data analytics
6) Data visualization
7) Embedded systems


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
- Variable is container which store values and used to perform different operations.Python is a dynamic typed language, which means we don't need to mention the variable type or declare before using it. Type is determined only during runtime.
Some examples to declare variables are below
x= 3.99   # Float type
X= 10     # Integer type
y= True   # Boolean type
z= "SQL"  # String type


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
- In Python, we ahve a function input() to take input data from user at runtime.
 Num1 = int(input("Please enter No.: "))
 Name = input("Please enter name: ")


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
- The default datatype of input() function is str.


Q8. What is type casting?
- The process of converting the value of one data type to another data type is called type casting.
  e.g a = int("123") # Type casting datatype string '123' to int


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
- Yes we can. We have a split() function in Python. Below is the example
x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
print("Number of boys: ", x)
print("Number of girls: ", y)



Q10. What are keywords?
- Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.Some of the examples are import,or,and,while,if,elif,else.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
- No, we can not use keywords as a variable because these are reserved for specific purposes.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
- Indentation in Python refers to the whitespaces at the start of the line. We can create indentation using space or tabs. When writing Python code, we have to define a group of statements for functions and loops. This is done by properly indenting the statements for that block.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
- In Python, we can simply use the print() function to print output. For example
print('Python is my world')


Q14. What are operators in Python?
- In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.
There are different group of operators available:
1) Arithmetic Operator (+,-,*,/,%)
2) Assignment Operator (=,+=,-=,%=)
3) Comparison Operator (==,!=,<,>,>=)
4) Logical Operator    (and,or,not)


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
- Both of them are arithmatic operators
1) / is used for float division
e.g print(5/3) #gives o/p as 1.66

2) // is used for integer division
e.g print(5/3) #gives o/p as 1


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
- 
N= 'iNeuron'
print("Output=",N*4)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
-
Num = int(input("Please enter No.: "))
if (Num % 2 == 0):
   print("Number is Even")
else:
   print("Number is Odd")



Q18. What are boolean operator?
- There are three boolean operators that are used to compare values
1) and -> Returns true if both statements are true 
2) or -> Returns true if one of statements are true
3) not -> Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true ond vice versa
e.g.
Num1=12
Num2=5
print("Num1<10 and Num2<10 " , Num1<10 and Num2<10) #False
print("Num1>10 or Num2<10 " , Num1>10 or Num2<10) #True
print("not(Num1<10 and Num2<10) " , not(Num1<10 and Num2<10)) #True


Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
-
# Returns 1 if any one of operands is 1
print(1 or 0)  #o/p is 1
# Returns 1 only if both the operands are 1
print(0 and 0) #o/p is 0
#Returns true if all statements are true
print(True and False and True) #o/p is False
# Returns 1 if any one of operands is 1
print(1 or 0 or 0) #o/p is 1



Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
- Conditional statements are also known as decision-making statements. We need to use these conditional statements to execute the specific block of code if the given condition is true or false.
In Python we have the following statements:
1) If statements
2) If-else statements
3) Elif statements
4) Nested if and if-else statements



Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
- These are conditional statements and helful in decision making. We need to use these conditional statements to execute the specific block of code if the given condition is true or false.
e.g.
Marks = int(input("Enter Marks :"))
if Marks > 90:
    Print("A+")
elif Marks<90 and Marks>70:
    print("A")
elif Marks<70 and Marks>50:
    print("B+")
else: 
    print("B")



Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
-
Age = int(input("Please enter age : "))
if (Age >= 18):
   print("I can vote")
else:
   print("I can't vote")



Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
-
# creating a list
list1 = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
total = 0
r = 0 
while(r < len(list1)):
    if (list1[r] % 2 == 0):
        total = total + list1[r]

    r += 1
     
print("Sum of even numbers :", total)



Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
-
num1 = int(input("Please enter No.1: ")) #taking input no.1
num2 = int(input("Please enter No.2: ")) #taking input no.2
num3 = int(input("Please enter No.3: ")) #taking input no.3
if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   print("Maximum is:",num1)
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   print("Maximum is:",num2)
else:
   print("Maximum is:",num3)



Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
- The number must be divisible by five
# creating a list
list1 = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
r = 0 
while(r < len(list1)):
    if (list1[r] % 5 == 0):
        print("Number divisible by 5 :", list1[r])
    r += 1

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
# creating a list
list1 = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
r = 0 
while(r < len(list1)):
    if (list1[r] <= 150):
        print("Number :", list1[r])
    r += 1

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
# creating a list
list1 = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
r = 0 
while(r < len(list1)):
    if (list1[r] > 500):
        break # Stop loop
    else:
        print("Number :", list1[r])
    r += 1
